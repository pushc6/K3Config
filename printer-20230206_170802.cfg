# This file has been created by Trails, of Annex Engineering, for the K3 3D Printer.
# Please change settings for your specific build or ensure you place your items in the same spots on the same MCU as I have.
# I've added as many options as I can think of for different displays as well as listed the available commands you can use via the terminal at the bottom of this configuration file.

#THIS CONFIG IS FOR A 180mm x 180mm x 180mm K3 PRINTER ONLY FOR THE FYSETC SPIDER CONTROLLER
#PLEASE READ THE WHOLE CONFIG BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO DO ANYTHING
#CONNECTORS/PORTS ON THE CONTROLLERS ARE NOTED WITH COMMENTS FOR EACH LOCATION/INPUT/OUTPUT

# use the following modifiers before the pin definition (ex: ^!ar99)
# ! 			invert the logic
# ^ 			activate 5v pullup (does not apply to all pins)
# mcu_name: 	use pins on additional MCU (ex: z:ar10)
